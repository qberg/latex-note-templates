\section{Motivation}

This is an introductory class about algorithms and their complexity.
I intend this class to be quite practical as it may be one of the most important classes for your future
career.  I would like to give three arguments to substantiate this claim.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Five years after their students have graduated, Stanford University 
      regularly asks their former students to rank those classes that were the most useful for their professional
      career.  Together with programming and databases, the class on algorithms consistently ranks highest.
\item On \href{https://quora.com}{Quora}, the answers to the question

      \hspace*{0.0cm}
      ``\href{https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-5-most-important-CS-courses-that-every-computer-science-student-must-take}{
        What are the 5 most important CS courses that every computer science student must take?}''
      \\[0.1cm]
      consistently list the class \blue{algorithms and data structures} among those courses that are most valuable
      for a professional career.  
\item The practical importance of the topic of this class can also be seen by the
      availability of book titles like
      ``\href{https://www.amazon.com/Algorithms-Interviews-Adnan-Aziz/dp/1453792996}{Algorithms for Interviews}''  
      \cite{cormen:01} or the \href{http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4RRi_ntQc8}{Google job interview questions}.
\end{enumerate}
